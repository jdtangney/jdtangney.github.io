I gave up on my previous attempts to use Eclipse and EASE as a CMS. The latter was broken for many months across many Eclipse releases. And to be frank, I am done with Eclipse. Yes, it's taken me this long to finally dump it in favor of VSCode and IntelliJ.

So here we are, in FrontMatter inside VSCode, using the same ol' GitHub Pages publishing mechanism. Given that I want more domain flexibility than I can (easily?) attain with GitHub, I'm considering moving everything to CloudFlare Pages, which is where most of my domains are registered and my DNS is configured. I'm in expansion mode, you see.
