When I first started down the road of selling everything I own and moving to Europe, it seemed like there was plenty of time. But then I delayed and ratholed and spun my wheels for six months, piling on the anxiety and self-inflicted stress. I think I have finally figured out that I can self-uninflict those same stresses by simply changing my plan. It's my plan, after all.

Looking down the barrel of 2024 — and worse, having to go back to work — puts my milestone into context. 2023 is ending with a cough and a fizzle, but 2024 has promise. Its promise is not in the realm of resolutions, but is based on the culmination of much planning. A milestone.
