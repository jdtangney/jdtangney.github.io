title: Scripting Eclipse with EASE
---

[EASE](https://www.eclipse.org/ease/) is Eclipse Advanced Scripting Environment. It's
been around for a while. I just used it to automate creation of a new blog posting. I feel
so 1999.

It supports multiple scripting languages, but I chose Python — actually it's Jython — and made
a cute little 16x16 icon to launch it. I type something in Markdown then do a `git push` and 
the rest is magic.
